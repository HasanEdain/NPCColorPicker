# NPCColorPicker
## This is a lightweight color picker for iOS. Written in modern swift, delivered as a framework

* iOS 9.1 target
* 100% Swift code
* Simple adoption
* Very lightweight (1 storyboard, no images)
* Bitcode enabled

>Note: Only the color chips are delivered by the framework, the button and the larger green chip are part of the example application.

##Simple use:
1. Download code

2. Compile Framework

3. Add Framework to your project

4. Add a UIView that will contain the colors (don't forget to constrain the view)

5. Adopt the NPCColorPickerViewDelegate protocol
>     class ViewController: UIViewController, NPCColorPickerViewDelegate
6. Make and initialize an NPCColorPicker variable in your viewController: 
>     var colorPicker = NPCColorPicker()

7. Place the pickerView in your view: 
>     self.colorPicker.embedColorPickerInView(self.embedView, forDelegate: self)

8. Customize as desired
>        You can set the colors to a gradient of your choosing
>        self.colorPicker.changeColorToGradient("ff0000", endColor: "0000ff", steps: 32)
>
>        You can use your own set of colors (Alpha and hash tag #ffffffff is also supported)
>        self.colorPicker.changeColorSet(["ffffff","ff0000","00ff00","0000ff","000000"])
>
>        You can set the size of the touch targets for the colors
>        self.colorPicker.changeDiameter(32.0)
>
>        You can change the shape of the touch targets for the colors
>        self.colorPicker.changeMaskStyle(.roundedRect)
>        .square, and .circle are provided as well

9. Implement the single delegate method:
>	    func colorChosen(color: UIColor) {
>               self.colorView.backgroundColor = color
>       }
    
# Now you have a color picker.
What you do with it is up to you.

## Possible improvements:
* a method to provide a mask and or a frame for chips
* more flexible color strings (RGBA, HSV, etc...)
* more flexible layout options
